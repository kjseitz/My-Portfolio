      <p>
        Last spring, the Presidential Fellows went to the Family Resource Center
        to learn about their organization and to assist them with putting
        together some send home items. We colored paperbags that would be used
        to hold food that the kids could take home. We also sorted through their
        books and created piles that had one of each book to send home with the
        kids. Although it was very simple, it still saved the staff time.

      <h2 class="fw-bold">Cards for Seniors</h2>
      <p>
        A friend of mine and I are apart of a scholarship group called Give
        Something Back, so we decided to have a Give Back Gives Back event with
        the other scholarship students at Pittsburg State University. The same
        friend of mine also works at a senior assisted living facility, so we
        made holiday cards for the residents living there. We also did this in
        February for Valentine's Day. After making the cards, we took them to
        the facility and handed them out to the residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        This event was really sweet and I was really happy to do this. I
        remember visiting my great-grandma when she was living in an assisted
        living facility and how much it meant to her.
