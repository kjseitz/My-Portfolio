        My name is Kaia Seitz and I am senior at Pittsburg State University. I
        am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and
        Computing. I am passionate about learning and love to get all the
        knowledge I can. I am the Vice President of the Computer Science Club
        and enjoy getting to share and learn about things we have all come
        across in the field. I try to leave a positive impact on those around me
        and influence them to become the best people they can be.

        The part of my life that has had the most influence on me and who I am
        is being the oldest sibling of six kids. There were two years that I was
        an only child and that was a time I will not remember because now I have
        five amazing siblings. They are the reason I do what I do. As the
        oldest, I am the role model. They all look up to me and watch every
        single thing that I do. I have known this for a long time and its shaped
        my life and its made me want to be a better person for them.

        I chose the word persistent as my one word because that's what I am.
        Throughout my life I have been put in tough situations and I have always
        been able to get through them. I get pushed down and I still get back up
        every time. I am persistent because I keep pushing through even when
        things are rough.

      <h2 class="fw-bold">Inspirations</h2>
      <p>
        I mainly draw inspiration from what the movies I watch, books I read, the music I listen to, and the video games I play. When I see a quote that I like, I write it
        down somewhere. These are little pieces of inspiration that can shape who I am, pick me up when things get hard, or just really touch parts of my life.
